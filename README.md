# lein-droid

A Leiningen plugin to simplify Clojure development for Android
platform. See Marginalia docs [here](http://alexander-yakushev.github.com/lein-droid/).

## Usage

See the
[Tutorial](https://github.com/alexander-yakushev/lein-droid/wiki/Tutorial)
to start using lein-droid.

Since the 0.0.1 is released you can carefully try to use this. It will
surely crash, and burn and not work at all, but the release means that
I managed to make it work on my machine. So, good luck
experimenting:).
